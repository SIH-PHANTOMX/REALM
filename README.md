# 🎓 Digital Platform for Centralized Alumni Data Management and Engagement

## 📌 Problem Statement

Most educational institutions do not have a reliable or centralized system to manage their alumni data.  
Once students graduate, their contact information, academic records, and career updates are often scattered across multiple platforms or lost entirely.

Currently:

- Alumni communication is limited to **informal WhatsApp groups** or outdated mailing lists.
- Long-term engagement between alumni and institutions is **weak**.
- Institutions miss opportunities to involve alumni in **events, mentoring, internships, or fundraising**.

In today’s digitally connected world, the absence of a structured system **limits the potential of alumni relationships**.
